    <p>You are now finished with the experiment. Thank you again for your
    participation.</p>

    <p>Your authorization code was <%= @auth_code %>.</p>

    <p>We are examining how humans make decisions in the context of human-robot
    teams. The tasks that you just completed will help us to understand the balance
    between "exploitation" (taking advantage of known rewards) and "exploration"
    (going in search of potentially larger rewards). Our ultimate goal is to
    create a model for human decision making in the "explore-exploit" setting.</p>
