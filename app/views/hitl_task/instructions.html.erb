    <p>In this experiment, you will be maneuvering a robot to collect points.
    The experiment will be composed of 4 tasks of 10-15 minutes each. Each task
    is divided into 90 moves of the robot. The "Robot Control Panel" will be
    displayed on the lower screen. For each move, you will use this control panel
    to select a square in the 10x10 grid overlaid on the robot's environment.
    This "waypoint" will be represented by a RED dot. The robot - represented
    by a YELLOW dot - will then move to this location and a number of points
    will be displayed. Once the robot reaches its destination and you receive
    your points, you will be able to select a new waypoint. If you want, this
    waypoint <b>can be the same</b> as the previous one. <b>Your goal in each
    task is to collect the maximum total number of points over the course of the
    task.</b></p>

    <p>Depending on the task, the robot may travel at different speeds. This will
    make some tasks feel faster than others. During a given task, however, the
    robot's behavior will stay the same.</p>

    <p>In addition, one task will present you with a "certainty chart" to help
    you with your search. The chart will be a 10x10 grid of colored dots. The
    larger the dot and "warmer" the color, the more you know about that location
    in the grid. For example, you know more about a large RED dot than a small BLUE
    dot. The uncertainty chart will update as you conduct your search.</p>
 
    <p><b>For all tasks, you will be able to see the actual robot swimming in its
    off-campus tank on the upper screen. There will be 4 different views.</b></p>

    <p>When you are ready, click "Start Training" to bring up a new page with
    a short practice session. This is for you to familiarize yourself with how the
    tasks work. Afterwards, you will be prompted to move on to the experiment.
    There will be 4 tasks in all; you will be alerted once each is complete.</p>
