    <p> In this experiment, you will be maneuvering a robot to collect points.
    The experiment will be composed of 4 tasks of 5-10 minutes each. Each task
    is divided into 90 moves of the robot. For each move, you will select a
    square in the 10x10 grid overlaid on the robot's environment. This "waypoint"
    will be represented by a RED dot. The robot - represented by a YELLOW dot -
    will then move to this location and a number of points will be displayed.
    Once the robot reaches its destination, it will stay there until you choose
    a new destination. <b>Your goal in each task is to collect the maximum total
    number of reward points over the course of the task.</b></p>

    <p>Depending on the task, the robot may travel at different speeds. This will
    make some tasks feel faster than others. During a given task, however, the robot's
    behavior will stay the same for each of the 90 moves. You will not be able
    to select a new waypoint until the robot reaches its current destination.</p>

    <p>In addition, one task will present you with an "uncertainty chart" to help
    you with your search. The chart will be a 10x10 grid of colors. The brighter
    the color in the square, the less you know about that location in the grid. It
    will update as you conduct your search.</p>
 
    <p>When you are ready, click "Start Training" to bring up a new page with
    a practice session. This is for you to familiarize yourself with how the
    tasks work. Afterwards, a button will appear directing you to the first task.
    There will be 4 tasks in all; once each task is complete, a new button will
    appear.</p>
