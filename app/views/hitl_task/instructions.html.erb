    <p>In this experiment, you will be searching for points by remote controlling
    an underwater robot. The experiment will be composed of 4 tasks of 10-15
    minutes each. Each taskis divided into 90 moves of the robot. The "Robot
    Control Panel" will be displayed on the lower screen. For each move, you
    will use this control panel to select a square in the 10x10 grid overlaid on
    the robot's environment. This "waypoint" will be represented by a RED dot.
    The robot - represented by a YELLOW dot - will then move to this location and
    a number of pointswill be displayed. Once the robot reaches its destination
    and you receive your points, you will be able to select a new waypoint. This
    waypoint can be different from or the same as the previous one. <b>Your goal
    in each task is to collect as many points as possible.</b></p>

    <p>Depending on the task, the robot may travel at different speeds. This will
    make some tasks feel faster than others. During a given task, however, the
    robot's behavior will stay the same.</p>

    <p>In addition, the final task will present you with a "reward map" to help you
    with your search. The map will be a 10x10 grid of colored dots. The larger the
    dot and "warmer" (more RED) the color, the greater the reward at that location
    in the grid is likely to be. The reward map will update as you conduct your
    search.</p>
 
    <p><b>For all tasks, you will be able to see the actual robot swimming in its
    off-campus tank on the upper screen. There will be 4 different views.</b></p>

    <p>When you are ready, click "Start Training" to bring up a new page with
    a short practice session. This is for you to familiarize yourself with how the
    tasks work. Afterwards, you will be prompted to move on to the experiment.
    There will be 4 tasks in all; you will be alerted once each is complete.</p>
